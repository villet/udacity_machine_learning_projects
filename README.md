# Udacity – Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains the project works I submitted for Udacity's Nanodegree Program: Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch.

## Supervised Learning

### Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

I applied supervised learning techniques on data collected for the US census to help CharityML (fictional charity) identify groups of people that are most likely to donate to their cause.

## Neural Networks

### Project: Image Classifier Benchmark with PyTorch

A fictional self-driving car startup is deciding whether to build or buy an object detection algorithm for objects that may be on the side of the road. A fictional company, Detectocorp, claims an 80% accuracy rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a benchmark used to evaluate the state of the art for computer vision systems. I built my own image classifier using PyTorch, trained the neural network with the same CIFAR-10 dataset, and compared the accuracy rate with Detectocorp’s model.

## Unsupervised Learning

### Project: Identify Customer Segments (provided by Arvato)

I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The proprietary data (roughly 900k rows) was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and represents a real-life data science task.

# Install

This repository requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Additionally, Neural Network project requires [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to be installed. You also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

I recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this repository.

# Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level in one of the project directories and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook notebook_name.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
